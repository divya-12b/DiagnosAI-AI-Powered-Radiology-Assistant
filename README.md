This project presents DiagnosAI, an AI-powered radiology assistant designed to
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical image analysis. The system
leverages advanced deep learning techniques to interpret various types of
medical images, including X-rays, MRIs, and sonography. By automating the
process of disease detection and creating diagnostic reports, DiagnosAI aims to
assist radiologists in providing faster and more precise diagnoses. The system
incorporates a user-friendly interface that allows medical professionals to upload
images and receive comprehensive textual reports, reducing diagnostic delays
and improving patient outcomes. Pre trained AI models have been integrated on
specialized datasets of various organ images, ensuring robust performance
across multiple domains. This solution integrates Python-based deep learning
models with a web-based frontend to provide medical image analysis.
Ultimately, DiagnosAI seeks to bridge the gap between AI advancements and
healthcare needs, offering a practical tool to assist radiologists in their workflow.
